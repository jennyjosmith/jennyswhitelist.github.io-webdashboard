# Survey Analysis Visualization
### 




A community organization has experienced an unprecedented to blow to both new and incremental revenue. Not only has new membership declined, member retention has declined.

This organization needs to target membership as two-pronged effort: New Membership and Retention. This year’s survey was administered to members and non-members, with current members representing the vast majority of respondents. Among current members, this survey achieved a 17% response rate. The confidence level is 90% with a +/- 5.3% error rate. 

Retention is a key opportunity area for this organization for incremental revenue and sustainability. As you’ll see in the survey findings, retention efforts today aren’t meeting the mark for members.
